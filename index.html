          We believe that there is nothing like a white water river trip for
          exhilarating fun. That is why we subscribe to the White Water Rapids
          philosophy of boatingand kayaking. Keeping the splashes coming for us
          means taking on some sick white water on the rivers we love.

          That doesn't mean we don't also like ralaxing. Opposites in all things
          after all. We believe that that the calm beautiful water makes you
          appreciate the tenseness of when you are looking down the tongue of a
          big string of waves makes.
